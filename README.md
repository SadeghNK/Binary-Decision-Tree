# Binary Decision Tree
Matlab implementation of recursive binary decision tree on MONK datasets.

this was done as a college assignment about a year ago.


in part A, a simple decision tree is made for 3 monk datasets and accuracies are calculated.

in part B, the same tree on these data sets are pruned using "Reduced Error Pruning" algorithm.

part C is just a comparison between the first 2 parts.
